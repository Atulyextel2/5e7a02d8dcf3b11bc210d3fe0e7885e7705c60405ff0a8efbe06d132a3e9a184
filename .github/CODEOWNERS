# CODEOWNERS file
# This file tells GitHub who must review changes before they can be merged,
# when "Require review from Code Owners" is enabled in branch rulesets.

# The '*' pattern matches every file in the repository.
# Replace 'your-github-username' with your actual GitHub username (case-sensitive).
# To add more approvers later, just add more usernames or teams on the same line.
